INSTALLATION
============

To build roxoptr2 from source, you will need:

 * a reasonably POSIX-compatible UNIX or UNIX-like system
 * a working C (ISO/1999) compiler (gcc and LLVM/clang are good)
 * libSDL
 * libSDL_image
 * libSDL_ttf
 * zlib

Build and install with the typical GNU-style triplet of:
  ./configure
  make
  make install		# as root

If there is no ./configure script, you've probably got a copy of the
development tree. Make sure you have GNU autoconf and automake, and
run ./bootstrap.sh to generate all the boilerplate code.

To build the game for the Wii, you will need:
 * the typical unofficial Wii SDK:
   - devkitPPC
   - libogc
   - portlibs
 * SDL wii
 * a reasonably UNIX-like system

Make sure ${DEVKITPRO} and ${DEVKITPPC} are set correctly (you probably
know the drill) and run
    ./configure --with-devkitpro
to configure, and 
    make
to build source/boot.dol (and source/boot.elf along the way)
