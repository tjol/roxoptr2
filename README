    \====================================================/

ROXOPTR2 is a simple SDL-based helicopter game similar to its amazingly
simple Python/Tkinter-based predecessor, rockopter.
You steer the helicopter around obstacles using your arrow keys or
(on the Wii) the D-pad on your primary WiiMote. 
Leaving the playing field or running into obstacles is fatal. Be sure to
note that an obstacle might just look like an obstacle but actually allow
you to pass.

Roxoptr2 is known to run on the Wii with Homebrew Channel, on ix86 and
amd64 Linux, i386 FreeBSD, and on Microsoft Windows. It should also
run on any other POSIX-compatible system that is supported by SDL, SDL_image
and SDL_ttf.
