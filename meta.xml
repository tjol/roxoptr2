    <short_description>Helicopter fun.</short_description>
    <long_description>
        It's simple: fly the little helicopter around all those BIG
        obstables. Don't leave the playing field! (except at the right
        places) Where are these places? You'll see. Or maybe you won't,
        but then you can always play again.

        New in this version:
            * animation
            * new levels
            * better collision detection
            * did I mention the new levels?

        Control the heli with the D-Pad on your primary WiiMote.

        Thanks a lot to Mr_Nick666, of Wii Double Down fame, for his amazing
        artwork.

        Roxoptr2 is a free game.
